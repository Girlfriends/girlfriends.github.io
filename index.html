					Morphosis is a global architecture firm with an expansive portfolio. Each work of theirs makes a strong visual impression, and we designed and developed their homepage to emphasize scale and color. Given the breadth of their interests, the challenge was to find a simple interface to present a large collection of pieces, and we worked to find a clean design that made their prolific output easy to navigate.

					Rhythm Necklaces are circular representations of repeating patterns. We first learned about them while exploring new ways to compose music. It turns out that the geometric properties of these objects—their balance and symmetry—affect not only their shape but also the way they sound.
					So what if there was a way to compose music by playing with shapes? Inspired by that possibility, we started a collaboration with artist and designer Meara O’Reilly. The iOS app that we built offers a new way to compose, shaping music by rotating, flipping and stretching rather than placing musical notes.

					Have you ever picked up your phone and wondered, “This phone, am I holding it?” The Holdr app answers that question clearly and instantly, announcing “You are now holding your phone” in a calm, reassuring voice whenever the phone leaves the ground.
Though plenty of people have taken it seriously, Holdr was intended as a joke, part of the <a href="http://www.stupidhackathon.com/" target="new">Stupid Hackathon</a> in NYC.

						What if you wanted to explain a neural network to someone who knows nothing about them? During residency at DBRS Innovation Labs, we worked on a Virtual Reality experience to help explain what neural networks are actually doing. It’s easy to obtain a mathematical description of a neural net, but we wanted to try to give a picture of its internal workings, so that users could walk away with an intuitive understanding of how learning networks operate.
					</p>
					<p>
						The project works with a convolutional neural network called LeNet, a type of feed-forward network modeled after the visual cortex of an animal. Users are able to draw their own numbers with their hands (the movement of their fingers is captured by a Leap Motion sensor) and then watch in real time how the algorithm analyzes their writing. Users can view the neural network from different angles and change the view to see all of the networks layers at once or zoom in on a specific layer.
