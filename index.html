					Morphosis is a global architecture firm with an expansive portfolio. Each work of theirs makes a strong visual impression, and we designed and developed their homepage to emphasize scale and color. Given the breadth of their interests, the challenge was to find a simple interface to present a large collection of pieces, and we worked to find a clean design that made their prolific output easy to navigate.

					Rhythm Necklaces are circular representations of repeating patterns. We first learned about them while exploring new ways to compose music. It turns out that the geometric properties of these objects—their balance and symmetry—affect not only their shape but also the way they sound.
					So what if there was a way to compose music by playing with shapes? Inspired by that possibility, we started a collaboration with artist and designer <a href="http://www.mearaoreilly.com/" target="new">Meara O’Reilly</a>. The iOS app that we built offers a new way to compose, shaping music by rotating, flipping and stretching rather than placing musical notes.

						When Girlfriends Labs isn’t developing, we spend a lot of time reading. Fiction and poetry make excellent literary fodder, but more than once we’ve found ourselves losing track of time reading Wikipedia article after Wikipedia article. One day we started to wonder, what could we do to express our love for Wikipedia?
					</p>
					<p>
						Head to wikison.net and you’ll see a 14 line poem, arranged in three rhyming quatrains and one closing couplet. This is a computer generated poem, but unlike most algorithmic writing, the text is written by a human being. As you can tell by hovering over each line, the original text is drawn from a wikipedia page. We wrote a program that scans Wikipedia, finds all the lines in iambic pentameter, arranges them by rhyme class and grammatical structure, and writes new poems on demand. Wikisonnet has been featured at the 2016 <a href="http://www.xcoax.org" target="new">xCoAx</a> Conference in Bergamo, Italy.

						Working under Dr. Tara McAllister Byun, students at the NYU Speech Therapy Lab built a working prototype of an iOS app they call staRt. Their goal was a colorful, friendly speech therapy app that kids would enjoy using.
					</p>
					 <p>
					 	As the project started to reach a certain size, Dr. Byun approached us to take the students’ initial work and to port it to a new architecture that would make the app more scalable and maintainable. We took the original code, which was written for iOS only, and ported it to the cross platform Ionic framework. Additionally, we separated the interface to the app from the audio backend that processes and analyzes speech, so that students with different skill sets could work on the app independently.

					For anyone who wants to make their computer do strange, profound, weird and beautiful things, Max/MSP is an indispensable tool. We’ve been avid Max users for as long as we’ve been programming, so for us it was an amazing opportunity to work on Mira, an iPad app for Max.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mira wants to make the process of controlling a patch from an iPad as easy as possible, and it overcomes a lot of technical challenges to make setup completely transparent to the user. Using Bonjour for zero-configuration connection, Mira connects to Max automatically, and uses a customized OSC protocol running over TCP and UDP to provide a fast and reliable connection. In 2013, We presented Mira at the <a href="http://nime.org/proceedings/2013/nime2013_241.pdf" target="new">New Interfaces for Musical Expression</a> conference, as well as <a href="https://vimeo.com/63846055" target="new">Code Control Leicester</a>.

						What if you wanted to explain a neural network to someone who knows nothing about them? During residency at DBRS Innovation Labs, we worked on a Virtual Reality experience to help explain what neural networks are actually doing. It’s easy to obtain a mathematical description of a neural net, but we wanted to try to give a picture of its internal workings, so that users could walk away with an intuitive understanding of how learning networks operate.
					</p>
					<p>
						The project works with a convolutional neural network called LeNet, a type of feed-forward network modeled after the visual cortex of an animal. Users are able to draw their own numbers with their hands (the movement of their fingers is captured by a Leap Motion sensor) and then watch in real time how the algorithm analyzes their writing. Users can view the neural network from different angles and change the view to see all of the networks layers at once or zoom in on a specific layer.
